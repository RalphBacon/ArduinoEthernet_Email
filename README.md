How to send Email using your Arduino and an Ethernet controller plus much more

Last video (#74) we looked at serving up a web page from your Arduino hooked up to an Ethernet controller module or shield. We had to use some memory-saving techniques to get it all in.

This video (part 2) we look at a better way of serving up web pages from your Arduino, getting the current date & time from a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server, and finally get to send that all-important email to your mailbox using SMTP. Phew!
